# GPT Language Model From Scratch
![Model](model3.png)

A decoder-only GPT language model implemented entirely from scratch using PyTorch and trained on the Shakespeare dataset at the character level.

The project recreates the core building blocks of modern autoregressive language models, including tokenization, positional embeddings, multi-head self-attention, transformer blocks, and autoregressive text generation.

## Project Overview

This project was built to gain a deep understanding of how GPT-style language models work internally by implementing the entire architecture from scratch instead of relying on high-level frameworks.

The model is trained using next-token prediction on Shakespeare's complete works and generates Shakespeare-style text from custom prompts.
